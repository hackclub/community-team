# Hack Club's Community Team 

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹    
First of all, know that being a member of the online community means you can craft and change and form it how you like, and doesnâ€™t require membership in the **@commieteam**. We believe the HC Slack to be hackable. Do you see something that could be improved? Something thatâ€™s broken? Weâ€™re open source! (I'd link to the repo but you're already here lol)

#### If you have ideas or feedback for us, you can do so:
##### Publicly
- By posting in [#community](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01D7AHKMPF)
- By creating an issue on this repo
##### Privately
- By DMing any of the members of the community team
- By emailing us at [conduct@hackclub.com](mailto:conduct@hackclub.com) (this is the best way to reach us if you want to remain anonymous and all emails are sent to the the team private channel)

### Who are we?
The Community Team is a group that is committed to help make the HC Slack the best place to be if youâ€™re a technical teenager. 

The Community Team is made up of:
- **@commieteam** (duh) The HCer led group that you are most familiar with. See below for more info on our roles and responsibilities. Our current members are 
    - [@Arpan](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U0409FSKU82)
    - [@arv](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U01MPHKFZ7S)
    - [@fayd](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U014ND5P1N2)
    - [@gaurav](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U043Q05KFAA)
    - [@Sahiti](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03RU99SGKA)
    - [@toby](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U02C9DQ7ZL2)
    - [@zsh](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U016S3C7JS2)
    

- Weâ€™ve recently added [@cwalker](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/UDK5M9Y13) and [@jc](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03MNFDRSGJ) to the Community Team as FT staff, to help make the online space the most buzzy, fun, technical and magical realm there is. 
- Hack Clubâ€™s founder, [@zrl](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U0266FRGP) provides the longer term organization-level vision for its online community. [@kara](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U032A2PMSE9) is accountable to this vision by supporting and managing the **@commieteam** and staff members.
- You. We are accountable to you, the community. We are here to help you and make the HC Slack the best place to be if youâ€™re a technical teenager.

### What do we do?
> **@commieteam** members keep the online community a positive, technically-focused, wholesome and teen-lead space. 

- We welcome warmly new members and help them find their tribe and village. We keep our onboard flows up-to-date, and fix bugs. We are constantly getting insights from newcomers, and voice feedback to the team so we can iterate and improve the Slack for our new members.

- We help direct people to places theyâ€™ll enjoy, and we cheer, support, draw people to, and lead technical, fun initiatives online.

- We are the friends and supporters of people and activity that embodies HCâ€™s hacker values. We take the time to read and respond to [#ship](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0M8PUPU6)s and [#scrapbook](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD)s, and elevate our amazing and inspiring community members.

- We keep the online community up-to-date on the current activities available (eg keeping [#happenings](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C05B6DBN802) updated, help with content for [#newsletter](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C03U48CQ1BL)s, check that the website and github is up-to-date). We guide members looking for things to do. 

- We moderate the Slack including handling spam, advertising, adults, email enquiries, and knowing how to effectively diffuse tense situations. There is some admin/archiving/database management included in this. Our moderation process follows our [CoC](https://hackclub.com/conduct) very closely. All moderation is visible and discussed by the team, by posting in the channel.

- We watch channels for feedback and concerns about the online community, and bring this to the teamâ€™s attention. We listen to the community, and iterate and improve, constantly.

- As a group, we hear and represent the diversity of our online community.

- We all voice opinions on anyone wishing to join the **@commieteam**, and we assist in onboarding and training and coaching new members.

- We will host teen-lead ad hoc community events such as powerpoint parties, code in the dark, [#operation-flagpole](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C05NR59J129) and [#100-days](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C05RQPBJTNW). These are often experiments, often imperfect, likely over-engineered, and often built as we go along. Be inspired by this hackiness when you run yours, too :)

- We take personal privacy and the safety of our community of minors very seriously. 

- We maintain this repo.

### How to become a commie â˜­?

~~Read and memorize the manifesto of the communist party and have a determination to end capitalism.~~ (jk)

If you are interested in joining the **@commieteam**, or would like to nominate someone, please reach out to any of the current members of the team! 

As a team, we consider each person very carefullyâ€“ we ask ourselves things like:

- Does this person wholly embody HC values and is respected and known in the community?
- Does this person *get* the community, love it dearly, and want to see it grow and improve?
- Is this someone who can hear and respond to feedback, and use it to better themselves, the team and the community? 
- Is this someone people would trust to come to with tricky and challenging personal situations? 
- Is this person reliable, accountable, andâ€¦ most of allâ€¦ going to be available! (Are they about to have a really busy spell at school?)
- Is this person respectful of othersâ€™ privacy?
Does this person fill a gap we have in the group?

We are a small group, and we are not looking to grow the team too much. We are looking for people who are passionate about the community, and who are willing to put in the time and effort to make it better.
